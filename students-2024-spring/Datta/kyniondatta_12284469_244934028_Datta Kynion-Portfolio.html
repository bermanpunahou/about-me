                I was born in North Carolina in Charlotte, then moved to South Carolina when I was around 2. After that I moved to Florida then Cailfornia then Hawaii. When I was in 3rd grade, I moved to Germany for five years then back to Hawaii which is where I live now. The reason my family moves a lot is because my dad is in the millitary.

               I do cross country in the fall and track in the spring. Additionally I am in the beekeeping, chess, and cyber club. Outside of school I take piano and I'm also in a Boy Scout troop where we do a lot of camping and hiking. On the weekends, I like going to the mall or Dave and Busters with my friends.

                One fun fact about me is that I hate cloudy and rainy days. They always seem really depressing and sad compared to sunny days. My favorite foods are chesse pizza, Japanese chicken curry, and frozen yogurt and my least favorites are rasins and apple juice. There is a slideshow of my favorite foods shown on the left.
