        <h3><b> About Me </b></h3>
        <p> My name is Ava Grace Cachola Butay. My birthday is December 24, <i> it's not as cool as it seems.</i> I have
          1 younger brother and a dog named Ollie, after Muhammad Ali. My favorite color is purple, my favorite food is
          pasta, and my favorite animal is a dog. Some main things about me is that I am a good listener, patient,
          incredibly shy, and even more sarcastic. I like to keep my friend group small and oftentimes I actually prefer
          to be alone. I highly believe in quality over quantity, and that you can't always wait for something to
          change, you have to do something about it and it definitely won't just happen overnight.</p>

        <h3><b> Why I Took The Class </b></h3>
        <p> I took computer science because growing up I did a lot of simple coding games because my dad works in IT so
          of course it was his version of fun and a win-win situation; me and my brother got to be on electronics, but
          our brains were still being challenged. As much as I hate to admit it, I really enjoyed coding and liked how
          it tested my thinking as well as my understanding. Since Punahou has a variety of classes that other schools
          may not have, each year I try to take advantage of that when choosing classes and this year I ended up with
          Computer Science.</p>

        <h3><b> My Goals </b></h3>
        <p> My goal for the rest of my high school career is to expand my comfort zone. I plan to do this by taking
          classes I wouldn't usually take, joining a variety of clubs, and speaking to more people in my community to
          get familiar with them because you never know in the future. Afterall my dad always says, it’s about
          <i>who</i> you know, not <i>what</i> you know. My dream job is to be a veterinarian because I would love to
          work with animals and see people happy because a happy pet equals a happy life. Another job interest is being
          a pediatrician or something that works with kids. I always say I’m not a kid person but I actually really
          enjoy working and conversing with them because it reminds me of when I was stress free and so excited to grow
          up.

        <h3><b> My Hobbies </b> </h3>
        <p> Some of my hobbies are sports, reading, and baking. I play softball and have been since I was 5 years old.
          For many years I was doing baseball, softball and hula all at once until I was 11 and decided to focus on
          softball. I have been with the same team for nearly 8 years even if we switched clubs and some people came and
          went. I am apart of the Punahou softball team and made the all-star second team last year as a freshman. My
          favorite genres for books are fantasy, romance and thriller. I always enjoy fictional books because I can
          imagine myself being a character and giving my brain a break from the real world for a little while. For
          baking my favorite thing is cookies. I like that theres a wide variety yet its a simple thing to bake. My
          favorite are these strawberry crinkle cookies made from cake mix and they are SO YUMMY!</p>
