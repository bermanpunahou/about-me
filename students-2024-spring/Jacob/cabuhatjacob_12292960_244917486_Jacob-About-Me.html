                <p>During my elementary years I attended Pearlridge Elementary. It's not a private school but is similar. I heard it's kind of like a feeder school which helps students get into private schools. I can see that considering I am in Punahou currently. The middle school I attended was Aiea Middle School. It wasn't exactly the best facility but I still met great people, including teachers, that I am still friends with today.</p>
